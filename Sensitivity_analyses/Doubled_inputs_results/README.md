This folder contains the results of the sensitivity analysis with "INPUT" variables set to twice as much.

"Withpred" files contain the number of matches found within each cohort as well as the PS within each level of exposure.
"Merged" files include the average PS overall and for each level of treatment, the standard deviation of the PS overall, and its the standardized mean difference.
"Withall" files include the outcome rates within the matched population of each simulation replicate.

Each file has a suffix defining which PS caliper width it represents the results of.
